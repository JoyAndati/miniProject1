# Mini Project - Sphere

## This Python script uses the cairo graphics library to create an image of a Halloween-inspired pumpkin sphere with eyes, nose, a frowning mouth, and longitudinal lines, resembling the look of a 3D globe.

### Draw the Pumpkin Sphere (draw_sphere function):

-A sphere is created using a radial gradient that shades from bright to dark orange, giving a 3D effect. 
-This function takes the center coordinates (center_x, center_y) and radius of the sphere.
-Different color stops in the radial gradient are applied to produce shading from bright orange at the center to darker orange at the edges.
